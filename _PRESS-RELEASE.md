 There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.
 
 For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.
 
 If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).
 
 If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 
 
 Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".
 
 Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
> Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

レージ(●o≧д≦o)タイプ! aka, rageType!


## Sub-Heading ##
> Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

"For when you're trying to code and the stuggle is real!


## Summary ##
> Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

* If you've ever tried to code, you've probably been in the situation where you have no idea what the hell you are doing... 

* Your mental model sucks, your whiteboard looks like a Roschach test, all your console.logs of data are 'undefined', and you've somehow decended into the 9th level of a callback hell that is nested inside 6 layers of for-loops that are somehow being run recursively but your base case is never reached.

* Enter レージ(●o≧д≦o)タイプ!, and take a minute to release your anger while making it seem like you're doing work! Start the timer and let the world burn! Type like an angry rabid badger and watch your rage turn into seemingly sensible code in the in-game terminal. The code looks "SO.... real...", that your boss might even think you're getting work done if he walks by! When the time is up see how much you actually typed, and maybe you'll earn a coveted spot on the High Score Board! 

* Enjoy on your own, or with your pair partner, and compete to see who can type the most nonsense in a minute!  When you're done, your stressed will have been reduced, your mind will be cleared, and you'll be ready to take another shot at the nightmare you've created for yourself! Or maybe it won't, but hopefully you'll've had fun ^-^!

Fight the machine!


## Problem ##
> Describe the problem your product solves.

* Primarily stress, but also boredom?

## Solution ##
> Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

* レージ(●o≧д≦o)タイプ! provides an outlet for your coding rage, while making it seem like you're doing work!

## Quote from You ##
> A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

* "I love this product! ... mostly because we made it... Not sure if it works though.... T.T" - Stephen Makowski, CTO


## How to Get Started ##
> Describe how easy it is to get started.

* It's pretty easy --- at least we think so! Press start to begin your sesh, and then start typing! 

## Customer Quote ##
> Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

* "レージ(●o≧д≦o)タイプ! is awesome! I ended up being let go because I couldn't implement the new feature I was supposed to create, but I had a lot of fun playing the game! and at least I still have chicken!" - Matt, recently fired from AirBnB/has chicken

## Closing and Call to Action ##
> Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

* Probably coming soon! Now get back to work!
